# Practical Task: Library Book Tracker API

Starter project for Data Architecture practical task: Build a REST API for managing books in a library using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and an H2 database.

## Task
Complete all of the 'TODO' portions of the code. The finished application should compile and all of the controller endpoints should be functional.

## Behavioural Requirements
- Books can be created
- All books can be retrieved
- A single book can be retrieved by ID
- Books can be deleted
- Books can be filtered and searched by their fields.
- Controller delegates to Service, which delegates to Repository
- DTOs are used for requests and responses

## Stretch goals
- Request validation
- Custom exception handling
- Searching by partial title
- Add 'borrow' and 'return' endpoints along with the new 'borrowedStatus' field to the Book entity
